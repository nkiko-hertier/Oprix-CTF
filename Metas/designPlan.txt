an SuperAdmin or Admin:

- For normal users they see a list of all public competions with Joined ones labled:

- Also add a live search through competitions

    # Competions Page:

    -if its normal user hide all tabs and show description plus a Join Button if team based the 
    may join by team else the user join anyway (analyse the API to get that logic) once done can see all and solve challenges as well.

    -Once other user admin/superadmin they normary see real competition with tabs plus create announcement features and add challanges.
    
    - For Teams and members only show teams tab case competitions is team based and all those tabs may get argument/attribute "competitionId"

    - Challenge Tab: guess the page looks clear if user is admin(hoster)/superadmin(but competition owner) see edit, then if user see solve button or solved if done

    - The Leaderboard page may hold few competition statstics the a list of users/teams based on competition type Ranked by score.
